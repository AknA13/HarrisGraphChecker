A Harris Graph is a graph that satisfies these 3 conditions:
Eulerian Condition: The graph must contain a Eulerian cycle
non-Hamiltonian Condition: The graph must not contain any Hamiltonian cycles
G-S Condition: For any number of vertices removed from the graph, S, the number of components of the resulting graph after the removal must have a number of components <= S.

This program will determine whether an inputted graph is a Harris Graph or not. The input format and the time complexity of the algorithm is stated in the comments of the java file.
